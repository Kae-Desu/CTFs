desc: What is 0x3D (base 16) in decimal (base 10)? \
hints: Submit your answer in our flag format. For example, if your answer was '22', you would submit 'picoCTF{22}' as the flag.

it seems like this is the same as "lets warm up" challenge before, but this time it's converting base 16 (hex) to base 10 (decimal), we could still use the previous converter https://cyberchef.org/

because its still in hex, we need to convert it to its respective form, from hex. after the hex was decoded the result is `=` so turn it into base10 (decimal) which then we got the result of `61`, the warp it in picoCTF{*} format
