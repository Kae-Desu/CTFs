theres a file named 'flag', which is basically the flag, to read a file in terminal one could either uses nano (a text editor), or cat (a command to print out what is inside a file)
,either way the output remain the same (but i reccomend using cat as its faster and less button pressed which saves time and the original way of doing this challange)\
