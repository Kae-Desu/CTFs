# CTFs
a repo of my CTFs Writeup, it's rather empty
in this writeup you'll see bunch of screenshot back and forth using either Linux, MacOS or even Windows. Pls keep in mind that this is nothing to worry about since everything still be solveable from Linux with any distros, here's a detail to OSes i uses

- Windows 10 Home
- Kali Linux 2022.2 (Debian Based)
- OSX 13.4 Ventura

Linux and MacOS command would much likely be the same. im currently working on documentation of pentesting tools for a bunch of operating systems more detail could be found in respective repo (haven't made the repo yet, its still on the obsidian note)
